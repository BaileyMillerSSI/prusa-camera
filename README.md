# Project Overview
A simple C# console application that can upload to PrusaConnect on an interval. This will allow devices such as Rasp Pis to connect a webcam and upload a single frame on a timer.

# Goals
1) Capture individual webcam frames and submit them to PrusaConnect
2) Provide a way to view "real-time" frames from the webcam
3) Integrate AI vision to send notifications (Similar to Bambu Handy app)
